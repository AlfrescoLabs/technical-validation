# This is a list of suggested TODO's for the tool, please update it if you see any of it can also be done by the tool.

API01: The tool is checking against http://docs.alfresco.com/5.0/concepts/java-public-api-list.html for a list of class names of the public API, this list is no longer available in the 5.1 document and hence the tool is out dated. A Jira has been raised: https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/BDE-507.

API03: Cannot be checked by tool easily, so OK to leave out.
API04: Cannot be checked by tool easily, so OK to leave out.
API05: OK
API06: OK

CM01: This is an easy manual check so tools are not required.

DEV01: This needs to be added to the tool to grep for <artifactId>alfresco-sdk-parent</artifactId> on pom.xml (Done)
DEV02: This needs to be removed or marked as "not strict" from the tool since it's removed in the document template.
DEV03: This appears similar to API04. Not sure if it is worthwhile adding to the tool a grep for “<module>” on *.xml, which will give you results on any Share extensibility modules used, maybe this belongs to a new criteria?

COM01: I wonder whether we need to ensure method names don't collide with those in Alfresco. If so, we should grep for 'org.alfresco.*'.
