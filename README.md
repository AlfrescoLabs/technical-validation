# technical-validation

Tool(s) for the technical validation of custom code that extends the [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com) open source document management system.

## Dependencies
 1. [Java 1.7+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
 2. [neo4j 2.0+](http://www.neo4j.org/)
 3. [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)
 4. [depends](https://github.com/pmonks/depends)
 5. [bookmark-writer](https://github.com/pmonks/bookmark-writer)

The following tool is also useful, though not used directly by the tool:

 1. [Ohcount](https://github.com/blackducksw/ohcount)

Note: these dependencies should be installed via your OS package manager, where possible.  On Mac OSX, I strongly recommend [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

## Installation

...is a huge pain right now as it requires building [depends](https://github.com/pmonks/depends), [bookmark-writer](https://github.com/pmonks/bookmark-writer) and the [validation tool](https://github.com/AlfrescoLabs/technical-validation) from source, and deploying the first 2 into a local Maven repository.

I'm working on getting an uberjar functional, at which point this'll involve downloading a single behemoth JAR file and running it directly.

## Running / usage

Assuming you get the source built and installed properly, you can...

```shell
 $ lein run -- -h
 -------------------------------+-------------------------------+----------------------------------

  -b, --binaries BINARIES                                        Binary folder or archive
  -n, --neo4j-url NEO4J_URL      http://localhost:7474/db/data/  URL of the Neo4J server to use
  -r, --report-file REPORT_FILE                                  The filename of the output report
  -h, --help
 -------------------------------+-------------------------------+----------------------------------
$ 
```
