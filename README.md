# technical-validation

Tool for the technical validation of custom code that extends the
[Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com) open source document management system.  In other words it's an
automated AMP file checker (both repo AMPs and Share AMPs).

Important note: this tool is still in alpha, and has issues including:
 * Criteria that are not yet checked at all
 * False positives
 * False negatives
 * Ugly output
 * Confusing output
 * Implicated in the recent measles outbreak in the United States

That said, in careful hands it can greatly expedite the process of technically validating an Alfresco extension,
by pinpointing potentially problematic areas of the code for further manual investigation.

## Dependencies
 1. [Java 1.7+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
 2. [neo4j 2.0+](http://www.neo4j.org/)
 3. [Ohcount](https://github.com/blackducksw/ohcount) (optional - without it some statistics will be missing from the
 reports generated by the tool)

Note: these dependencies should be installed via your OS package manager, where possible.  On Mac OSX,
I strongly recommend [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

## Configuration

Ensure "auto indexing" is enabled in Neo4J for the properties "name", "package" and "typename".  These are set in
the neo4j.properties file.

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/AlfrescoLabs/technical-validation/releases) and unzip the zip file
somewhere convenient.

## Running / usage

```shell
$ ./atv -h
 ------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter                    | Default Value                 | Description
 ------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------
  -s, --source SOURCE                                            Source folder (mandatory)
  -b, --binaries BINARIES                                        Binary folder or archive (mandatory)
  -n, --neo4j-url NEO4J_URL      http://localhost:7474/db/data/  URL of the Neo4J server to use (optional - see default)
  -r, --report-file REPORT_FILE                                  The filename of the output report (mandatory)
  -h, --help                                                     This message
 ------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------
$ 
```

or on Windows:

```Batchfile
C:\atv> atv -h
 ------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------
  Parameter                    | Default Value                 | Description
 ------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------
  -s, --source SOURCE                                            Source folder (mandatory)
  -b, --binaries BINARIES                                        Binary folder or archive (mandatory)
  -n, --neo4j-url NEO4J_URL      http://localhost:7474/db/data/  URL of the Neo4J server to use (optional - see default)
  -r, --report-file REPORT_FILE                                  The filename of the output report (mandatory)
  -h, --help                                                     This message
 ------------------------------+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------
C:\atv> 
```

The tool will write a lot of data to the Neo4J database specified in the command line parameters - it is strongly
recommended that that database be empty prior to each run of the tool.  It will also write the report file (in Word
.docx format) to disk.  Other than that it will not modify anything else on the machine its run on (most especially
the source code or binaries of your extension - they are only read).
