# technical-validation

Tool(s) for the technical validation of custom code that extends the [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.com) open source document management system.

## Dependencies
 1. [Java 1.7+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
 2. [neo4j 2.0+](http://www.neo4j.org/)

The following tool is also useful, though not used directly by the tool:

 1. [Ohcount](https://github.com/blackducksw/ohcount)

Note: these dependencies should be installed via your OS package manager, where possible.  On Mac OSX, I strongly recommend [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

## Installation

...is a huge pain right now as it requires using [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) to build [depends](https://github.com/pmonks/depends), [bookmark-writer](https://github.com/pmonks/bookmark-writer), and [validation tool](https://github.com/AlfrescoLabs/technical-validation) from source, and deploying the first 2 into a local Maven repository.

I'm working on getting a few more tests implemented, and will then prepare an uberjar-base release.

## Running / usage

Assuming you get the source built and installed properly, you can...

```shell
$ lein run -- -h
